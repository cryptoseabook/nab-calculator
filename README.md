# Nab (National Australia Bank) Interview Code Test

A simple calculator to show case Java Reflection usage, command line input, OO Programming, TDD Approach

## Code Test Details

### Description
The development team is agile team and adopts XP development methodology. The application will be written in Java.
The final product will be able to support more complex operations such as trigonometric functions (sine, co- sine, tangent and their reciprocals), calculus (integrals and derivatives) as well as logarithmic functions.
Iteration 1 Story
In this iteration (the first iteration), you are going to implement some basic arithmetic operations in the calculator firmware. To allow QA team to test the calculator, you need to write a command line Java program to take the inputs as arguments.


###  Acceptance Criteria:
 - Application user enters Operand Operation Operand as the java program arguments and then will get a result as output

### Details:
 - The acceptable Operation: +, -, * or /
 - The acceptable Operands: [0-9]+[.]?[0-9]*
 - No thousand separator (,) is required in outputs
 - Print the result to the console

### Development Notes:
 - The assessment will focus on object oriented design and whether the implementation is extensible. If all implementations are in one or two class, the assessment would be failed straightway.
 - All work must be done using a TDD approach.
 - Stories to build sine and cosine functions are scheduled in the next iteration.
